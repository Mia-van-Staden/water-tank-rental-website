        Three main packages will be offered: Basic (2,500L + budget pump), Standard (5,000L + brand
        pump), and Premium (dual 2,500L + VSD pump). Customers pay monthly for 24 or 36 months.
        Once ownership transfers, they can subscribe to a 10% annual service plan, ensuring steady
        long-term revenue. The business targets both poorer households (low monthly entry price) and
        wealthy clients (premium resilient solutions).
