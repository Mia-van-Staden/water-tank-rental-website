      <p>
        This business provides households and small businesses with access to water security
        through a rent-to-own model for JoJo tank and pump installations. Customers who cannot
        afford a large upfront payment can pay monthly over 24â€“36 months, after which ownership
        transfers and they may subscribe to a service plan. This model is inclusive, serving both
        lower-income households with entry-level systems and higher-income clients with premium
        setups.
