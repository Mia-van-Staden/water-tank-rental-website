      <p>
        South Africa faces regular water supply interruptions and load-shedding-related pump failures.
        Many households and SMEs cannot afford the R15,000â€“R30,000 lump-sum cost of a water
        tank system. Rent-to-own offers affordability while ensuring ongoing service income. The
        opportunity is large given national water insecurity and rising JoJo tank sales.
